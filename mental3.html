        <h2 id="h2">You might have Scitzophrenia</h2>
        <h3 id="h3">Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than one percent of the U.S. population. When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation.</h3><br>
        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <h3>Do not drink alcohol, use cannabis, or use illegal drugs. Having problems with drugs or alcohol makes treating schizophrenia harder. If you have problems with drugs or alcohol, you need to treat both that problem and schizophrenia to help yourself get better. Talk to your doctor if you have this kind of problem.</h3>
